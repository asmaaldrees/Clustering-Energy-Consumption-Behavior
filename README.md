# Clustering-Energy-Consumption-Behavior
Clustering Appliance Energy Consumption Data for Occupant Energy-Behavior Modeling.

In this project, we perform clustering on the time-series dataset to cluster occupant IDs with similar energy consumption characteristics and develop load profiles for each cluster. 
We used the Pecan Street dataset (https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/) to cluster building occupants based on the energy they consume for each appliance in the household, and then developed load profiles for each of the clusters.

The result of this work has been published on: the First ACM SIGEnergy Workshop on Fair, Accountable, Transparent, and Ethical (FATE) AI for Smart Environments and Energy Systems (https://fatesys.github.io/2021/).
