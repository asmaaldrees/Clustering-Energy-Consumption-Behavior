# Clustering-Energy-Consumption-Behavior
Clustering Appliance Energy Consumption Data for Occupant Energy-Behavior Modeling.

In this project, we perform clustering on the time-series dataset to cluster occupant IDs with similar energy consumption characteristics and develop load profiles for each cluster. 
We used the Pecan Street dataset (https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/)to cluster building occupants based on the energy they consume for each appliance in the household, and then developed load profiles for each of the clusters.
